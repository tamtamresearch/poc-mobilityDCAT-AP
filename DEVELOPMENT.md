# Development guide

This guide covers the toolchain: prerequisites, setup, building and linting
locally. For the editing and publishing procedures that use it - edit the draft,
tag a draft snapshot, create a release, promote it, hotfix it - see
[`PROCEDURES.md`](PROCEDURES.md).

## Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) — manages Node.js and uv versions locally

All build scripts are written in Python and work identically on Windows and Linux. No bash required on either platform.

### Installing mise

**Linux / macOS**
```sh
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

**Windows** (PowerShell or cmd)
```powershell
winget install jdx.mise
# or
scoop install mise
```

## First-time setup

```sh
mise install          # installs Node 24 and uv (uv installs Python 3.12 automatically)
mise run install      # npm install + uv sync (creates .venv with all Python dependencies)
```

## Build

```sh
mise run build        # full build: serialise Turtle + build ReSpec spec
```

All output is written to **`dist/`**. Open `dist/index.html` in a browser to preview the built specification.

Individual steps:

```sh
mise run clean        # empty dist/ (run automatically at the start of mise run build)
mise run serialise    # convert src/*.ttl and src/examples/*.ttl -> dist/*.rdf + dist/*.jsonld
mise run build-spec   # copy assets to dist/ and build dist/index.html via ReSpec
```

## Linting

```sh
mise run lint         # full build, then mise run check
mise run check        # all three checks below, on an existing build
mise run validate     # HTML markup validation only (requires a prior build)
```

`mise run lint` runs the full build, then `mise run check`, which:
1. Validates `dist/index.html` markup with `html-validate` (rules defined in `.htmlvalidate.json`)
2. Parses `dist/index.html` with `src/scripts/check-refs.py`, which cross-references all `id` attributes against all `href="#..."` links and prints each broken one
3. Validates the examples against the SHACL shapes with `src/scripts/validate-examples.py` (see [Validating the examples](#validating-the-examples))

ReSpec only reports a count of broken references in its CLI output — `check-refs.py` gives the actual list.

The checks run in this order and the first failure stops the task, so a broken
reference means the SHACL validation does not run. `html-validate` never stops
it: its 1749 errors come from the ReSpec-generated markup and are a baseline,
not a failure.

## Validating the examples

```sh
mise run validate-examples                  # src/examples/*.ttl against the SHACL shapes
mise run validate-examples -- --offline     # use only the cached imports
mise run validate-examples -- path/to/file.ttl
```

The shapes are the four constraint files in `src/shaclShapes/`. What they
`owl:import` is downloaded on the first run (about 8 MB, 20 seconds) into
`.cache/shacl/` and reused afterwards; `--refresh` downloads it again. The
controlled vocabularies from `mdr-imports.ttl` go into the data graph, because
the membership checks look them up there, and the DCAT-AP 3.0.1 base shapes go
into the shapes graph. Only results on nodes of the validated file are printed.
The task exits 1 on any `sh:Violation`; warnings are printed only.

The DCAT-AP `range.ttl` is left out unless `--with-dcat-ap-ranges` is given. Its
`sh:class` checks need an explicit type on every value, which the EU authority
tables do not carry, so on the current examples it reports every codelist value.
Validation runs without inference: RDFS inference over DCAT 2 makes every
`dcat:Catalog` a `dcat:Dataset` and applies the Dataset rules to it.

It is the last step of `mise run check`, so it runs in `mise run lint` and in CI.
CI keeps `.cache/shacl/` between runs, under a key that changes each month and
whenever a file in `src/shaclShapes/` changes.

## Live preview

To use ReSpec's interactive warnings panel in the browser:

```sh
mise run serve        # starts HTTP server on http://localhost:8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/src/index.html` in a browser. ReSpec runs live and shows a warnings badge at the top — click it to see all issues with locations. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.

## How it works

| Step | Script | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Serialise | `src/scripts/serialise.py` | Parses each `.ttl` with rdflib, writes `.rdf` and `.jsonld` to `dist/` |
| Copy assets | `src/scripts/copy-assets.py` | Copies the Turtle sources, examples, figures, and SHACL shapes to `dist/` |
| Build spec | `src/scripts/build-spec.py` | Calls `respec --localhost`, which spins up its own HTTP server, builds `dist/index.html`, and shuts down |
| Validate examples | `src/scripts/validate-examples.py` | Runs pyshacl on the examples; separate from the build |

`--localhost` is required because Chromium (used internally by ReSpec) blocks `file://` requests needed by `data-include`. All paths (`src/index.html` → `dist/index.html`) are defined in `build-spec.py`.

## Source layout

All hand-authored files live under `src/`. Never edit files in `dist/` — they are generated.

Turtle is the source format for the ontology and the examples. The `.rdf` and `.jsonld` serialisations are generated on every build and are never committed.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/mobilitydcat-ap.ttl` | Ontology — primary source of truth (Turtle) |
| `src/index.html` | ReSpec specification document |
| `src/config.js` | ReSpec configuration (version, editors, dates, bibliography) |
| `src/tables/` | HTML property tables included by `index.html` via `data-include` |
| `src/examples/` | Worked examples (Turtle) |
| `src/shaclShapes/` | SHACL validation constraints |
| `src/figures/` | UML diagrams |
| `src/enterpriseArchitectFiles/` | Enterprise Architect model (`.qea`) |
| `src/js/` | Custom JavaScript |
| `src/appendices/` | Appendix content (placeholder) |
| `src/scripts/` | Build scripts (Python) |

## Dependencies

| Tool | Version | Managed by | Purpose |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Node.js | 24 | mise | Runtime for ReSpec |
| respec | 36.0.0 | npm / `package.json` | Builds the HTML specification |
| uv | latest | mise | Python package manager |
| Python | 3.12 | uv | Runtime for build scripts |
| rdflib | 7.6.0 | uv / `pyproject.toml` | RDF serialisation |
| pyshacl | 0.31.0 | uv / `pyproject.toml` | SHACL validation of the examples |

- `.mise.toml` — pins Node and uv versions
- `package.json` — pins respec
- `pyproject.toml` — declares Python dependencies
- `uv.lock` — exact locked versions; commit this file for reproducible installs

## CI

Every publishing workflow builds through the reusable workflow
`.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml`, which runs the same mise tasks as
`mise run lint`, with the same tool versions from `.mise.toml`:
`mise run install`, `mise run build`, then `mise run check`. The build is
enforced; `check` runs with `continue-on-error`, so a failed check shows in the
log but does not stop a publish. A new check therefore goes into the `check`
task, not into the workflow. Which ref publishes
where is listed in `README.md`; the step-by-step procedures are in
[`PROCEDURES.md`](PROCEDURES.md).
